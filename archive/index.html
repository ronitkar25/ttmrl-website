                <p>Led by Dr. Susan Shea, PhD and Dr. Matthew Neal, MD, FACS, the Trauma and Transfusion Medicine Research Laboratory (TTMRL) is focused on improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients with trauma injury through improved prevention and interventions by conducting basic and translational science to using implementation and dissemination science principles to improve adoption of preventative measures to reduce traumatic injury, by describing the pathophysiology of traumatic injury, and advancing surgical and therapeutic strategies.
                    <br><br>The mission also includes improving the effectiveness and safety of blood products for all critically ill patients by investigating the differential biologic effects of blood product manufacturing and leveraging these differences to achieve precision transfusion medicine where the blood products transfused is optimal based on the patients' clinical condition and genetic predisposition.</p>

                <h1>Our Research</h1>
                <p>Trauma remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. At TTMRL, our research focuses on unraveling the biological responses to trauma, including the role of blood system failure in poor outcomes, to develop targeted therapies and optimize treatments for injured patients.
                    <br><br>
                    Our work can be broken down into several key areas:
                </p>       
                <ul>
                    <li>Biological Response to Trauma: Investigating how trauma-induced changes in the blood system, including thrombosis, inflammation, and thromboinflammation, contribute to patient outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Transfusion Science: Exploring the hemostatic capabilities of blood products, whether stored, synthetically developed, or collected through various methods, to enhance transfusion strategies.</li>
                    <li>Innovative Therapeutics: Identifying therapeutic targets through translational research with a focus on platelets and the blood system.</li>
                    <li>Predictive Insights: Conducting large observational studies to determine predictors of adverse outcomes following trauma.</li>
                    <li>Clinical Applications: Running clinical trials to test new therapeutics and resuscitation strategies for injured patients, ensuring our findings translate into real-world impact.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Our goal is to bridge biology and clinical care, improving survival and recovery for patients who suffer from severe injuries. <a href="research.html">Learn more.</a></p>
