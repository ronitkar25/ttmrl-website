        <h2>Understanding the Biological Response to Trauma</h2>

        <p class="project-description">
          The biological response to trauma is a complex, dynamic process involving the immune system,
          coagulation pathways, platelets, and endothelial function. Our lab investigates how traumatic injury
          disrupts
          homeostasis and initiates a cascade of dysregulated inflammatory and thrombotic responses. Key work
          has explored
          immune cell activation, including macrophage polarization and mobilization, platelet dysfunction,
          and endothelial interactions that contribute to systemic
          effects beyond the site of injury. Our work in this area is highly translational and aims to bridge
          the gap between basic science and clinical application using trauma patient blood samples.
          <br><br>
          Research has demonstrated that trauma can provoke maladaptive hemostatic responses such as
          trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality.
          Using in vivo models, clinical data, and specialized microfluidic devices, the lab has shown how
          altered platelet function,
          persistent von Willebrand factor multimer presence, and reduced ADAMTS13 activity exacerbate
          thromboinflammation. These insights help us understand clinical findings such as non-surgical
          bleeding, thrombotic
          microangiopathies, and end-organ damage following trauma.
          <br><br>
          Our work extends to central nervous system trauma, where the lab has studied platelet dysfunction
          in traumatic brain injury and the persistent inflammatory milieu it creates. The interplay between
          coagulation factors, cellular responses, and the injured endothelium remains a key research
          axis. These findings set the foundation for therapeutic strategies that modulate interactions
          between hemostasis and the immune system
          to improve outcomes in critically injured patients.

        <h2><br>Understanding the Effect of Transfusion Processes on Blood Products</h2>

        <p class="project-description">
          Modern transfusion practices are critical in trauma care, yet there is limited understanding of how
          storage, processing, and product manipulation affect blood component efficacy. The lab has studied
          the impact of various factors, such as cold storage, agitation, leukoreduction, and apheresis
          collection platforms, on platelet and plasma function. These studies have informed optimal handling
          techniques to preserve hemostatic potential while reducing complications associated with storage
          lesions and reduced metabolic integrity.
          <br><br>
          Work in this area includes evaluating key processing methods like pathogen reduction and the
          production of plasma supernatants from late-storage whole blood. These approaches aim to retain
          coagulation function and enhance shelf life while maintaining safety. The lab has also contributed
          to understanding how transfusion timing, dose, and product composition influence outcomes in
          patients with hemorrhagic shock, particularly through studies of low-titer group O whole blood use
          in both pediatric and adult trauma populations.
          <br><br>
          By applying both bench and clinical research methodologies—including viscoelastic assays and
          metabolomic profiling—the lab has helped define a more nuanced picture of what constitutes
          "high-quality" transfusion products. These findings support the broader goal of personalized
          transfusion strategies, where product selection is based not only on blood type compatibility but
          also on functional performance tailored to patient needs.

        <h2><br>Creating New Blood Product Solutions</h2>

        <p class="project-description">
          To address limitations of traditional transfusion therapy such as availability, shelf life, and
          immunogenicity, the lab is developing synthetic and bioengineered blood products. SynthoPlate is a
          leading example, designed to mimic platelet function through targeted nanoparticles that promote
          hemostasis at injury sites. Studies have shown SynthoPlate enhances clot formation and reduces
          bleeding in preclinical models, demonstrating its promise as a field-deployable hemostatic agent for
          military and civilian trauma settings.
          <br><br>
          This effort extends beyond SynthoPlate to the conceptual development of other bioinspired products.
          Research focuses on nanoparticle design,
          surface ligand optimization, and in vivo efficacy testing to ensure these agents replicate critical
          features of natural hemostasis. By bypassing reliance on donor-derived components, these products
          aim to reduce risk of transfusion reactions and allow for scalable, long-term storage—essential for
          austere or mass casualty environments.
          <br><br>
          The lab collaborates across disciplines including biological and biomedical engineering and
          materials science to
          optimize these technologies. Continued work in this area focuses on regulatory pathways, combination
          therapies (e.g., pairing synthetic platelets with antifibrinolytics), and real-world deployment
          models. These products hold the potential to revolutionize trauma care and fill gaps where
          traditional transfusion products fall short.

        <h2><br>Mediators & Therapies for Thromboembolism</h2>

        <p class="project-description">
          Thromboembolic disease is driven by the pathological intersection of thrombosis and inflammation.
          The lab’s work in this area focuses on uncovering the cellular and molecular mediators of clot
          formation and resolution, particularly in the setting of trauma, stroke, and critical illness. Key
          players such as platelets, neutrophils, and von Willebrand factor (VWF) are studied in detail to
          understand how they contribute to thrombus initiation, stabilization, and resolution. Advanced
          microfluidic models are leveraged to visualize these processes under physiologic flow, enabling
          real-time assessment of clot dynamics and cellular interactions.
          <br><br>
          A major translational effort centers on therapeutically targeting VWF, a critical mediator of
          arterial thrombosis. One study uses a microfluidic model of arterial occlusion to evaluate
          BB-031, an aptamer that selectively blocks the VWF-A1 domain. This inhibitor demonstrated superior
          thrombus clearance and reduced re-occlusive platelet deposition compared to conventional
          fibrinolytics like Alteplase and Tenecteplase, even when administered hours after occlusion. These
          findings highlight a paradigm shift in ischemic stroke treatment: from fibrinolysis to anti-adhesive
          therapies that prevent sustained occlusion and secondary thrombus growth.
          <br><br>
          The lab’s broader vision includes developing precision therapies that can modulate
          thromboinflammatory processes without impairing necessary hemostasis. This includes profiling
          patient-specific coagulation signatures using thrombin generation assays and viscoelastic testing,
          and identifying which individuals may benefit from agents like BB-031. By bridging mechanistic
          insights with therapeutic development, this work offers hope for safer and more effective treatment
          of thromboembolic disease—especially in settings where conventional anticoagulants and thrombolytics
          fall short.
