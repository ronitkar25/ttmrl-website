She has a broad background in bioengineering with specific training and experience in fluid mechanics, in vitro and ex vivo blood flow assay development and validation, flow chamber design and development, hemostasis and thrombosis, and devices. She has developed flow assays to answer specific questions on both the macro and micro scale.\n\nOne current focus of her research program is to elucidate and identify mechanisms of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), to further identify and develop the most efficacious hemostatic resuscitation strategies. To investigate this, she designs and builds microfluidic assays to study hemostasis under flow in robust platforms. Specifically, we have used microfluidic devices designed and implemented in her lab to study TIC, blood products, including having established a collaboration with Dr. Leeper to study pediatric trauma."

After graduation, he worked as a patient care technician in the Surgical Trauma ICU, an experience that deepened his interest in the physiological challenges of critical illness and led him to join TTMRL as a research technician before beginning his doctoral training.\n\nAt TTMRL, Jack’s work focuses on the role of platelet dysfunction in trauma-induced coagulopathy and its downstream effects on immune and endothelial cells. He uses advanced microfluidic platforms, flow cytometry, and animal models to study the dynamics of platelet behavior following severe injury, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets to mitigate long-term complications like organ failure. His projects span pediatric and adult trauma populations and incorporate both molecular analysis and translational modeling. He has presented his work at national and international conferences and is building a strong publication record as he advances toward an academic career in hemostasis and thrombosis research.\n\nOutside of the lab, Jack is currently training for a half Ironman later this year!"
