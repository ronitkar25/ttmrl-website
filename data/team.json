He is also in charge of writing up and modifying protocols as well as SOPs to keep the lab in compliance. When not in the lab, you can find Victor cycling around the city, paddleboarding nearby lakes and rivers, as well as singing his heart out with some late-night karaoke."

Scott has gained many years of experience in the laboratory through several industry jobs that were heavily protein chemistry-focused. This includes 17 years spent working on Department of Defense funded contracts to develop technologies for the detection and decontamination of chemical warfare agents. \n\n Scott is currently working on the DARPA funded Fieldable Solutions for Hemorrhage with bio-Artificial Resuscitation Products (FSHARP) Program, which aims to develop a shelf-stable whole blood analog that can be used for treatment of trauma patients in austere environments where traditional blood product availability may be limited. Scott spends his spare time trying to make sense of the world and telling his dog to stop eating weird stuff she finds on the ground. He’s been unsuccessful at both."

They later joined Carnegie Mellon University, where they specialized in training non-human primates, further expanding their experience in preclinical research. \n\n Kestrel originally joined the TTMRL as a research technician working on CHIPSiv, comparing the functionality of cold stored platelets to room temperature stored platelets. Since then, Kestrel has transitioned to the more administrative side of things and now serves as the TTMRL's assistant lab manager. They are still involved in CHIPS but now focus more on the regulatory side of things. They keep the lab in gloves and pipette tips and make sure the equipment functions as intended. \n\n Outside of the lab, Kestrel enjoys video games and ecumenical geotheological substrate collection."
